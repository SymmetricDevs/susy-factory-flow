 * - `all`   a drawer on every slot, wired or not, so a half-fed input tops up

/**
 * Close a plan's boundary: a SOURCE drawer on every ingredient nobody makes,
 * a DRAIN drawer on every product nobody takes.
 *
 * A board does NOT do this by default: declaring the boundary is the
 * player's job, and a card with a bare slot reads UNWIRED until they do. It
 * runs for:
 * - free inputs/outputs setup rules in calculateThroughput, at scope `all`
 *   (getSetupRules currently answers every plan with both off);
 * - `calculateSelectionFlow`, which solves a selection "as if it were the
 *   whole board": severing the wires would otherwise starve every scoped
 *   solve at the cut;
 * - solver fixtures whose subject is something else (allocation, balances,
 *   overclocks) and that assume raw materials turn up and products go away.
 *
 * The added drawers read as the plan's imports and exports in the books
 * (balances.ts reads boundary drawers), so a fed ingredient still shows as
 * something the plan NEEDS and a drained product as something it puts OUT.
 *
 * Do not use it in tests that are ABOUT the boundary: those wire their own
 * drawers, because which drawer sits where is what they check.
