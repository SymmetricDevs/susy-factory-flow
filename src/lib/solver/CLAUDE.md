# Solver (src/lib/solver)

Doctrine: if it would fail in the game, it fails in the planner; otherwise everything
runs. A fed machine with somewhere to put its output never idles. Nothing comes from
nowhere or goes nowhere except through a source, a drawer or trash. Longer version:
`docs/solver-equations.md`.

## Two LPs

`throughput.ts` is the entry. Build and Solve/Pool answer different questions:

- BUILD (counts are given): every act, edge flow and total comes from `equations-core.ts`
  (behind `EQUATION_BOOKS`). Stage chain, each optimum locked before the next: max total
  act; max-min fairness over acts (the game's round-robin); recycle before import; ship
  before banking; min total flow (determinism). No "product purpose" or "least machinery"
  stage: both idled machines the game would run. Equal-fill rows make co-consumers of one
  output port fill at the same rate (what kills a tapped break-even ring; only
  output-side figures may exempt a consumer). Power stalls are pinned to act 0 in the LP.
- SOLVE and POOL (counts are the unknowns): `solve-mode.ts` (`solveSolveMode`, finished by
  `finalizeSolveModeResult`). Targets ARE rows here. Objective: least machinery, then
  least imports, fill and flow. No fairness, equal-fill or stall pinning.
- The iterative engine (`equilibrium.ts`) still runs and supplies the DIAGNOSIS
  (capability, clog names, "one wire fixes it"). If an LP fails, the old books stand; a
  solve failure degrades, never crashes. Balance dust snaps at 1e-5 relative
  (`balances.ts`).
- Engines: `lp-engine.ts` uses HiGHS (WASM) when loaded, else the homegrown simplex
  (`simplex.ts`). Big or slow boards solve in a worker (`src/store/solve-books.ts`);
  nothing that size may run on the main thread.
- Node rates in results are FULL SPEED; actual = nameplate x `min(1, max(0, utilization))`.
- Only synchronous solves write `lastSolveDurationMs` in `solve-books.ts`; worker timings
  never un-slow a plan.
  "A big plan lags every edit": look first for a diagnosis running on the main thread.
- Exams: `equations-doctrine.test.ts`, `simplex.test.ts`. The tick simulator
  (`src/lib/solver-lab/simulate.ts`) is the independent "what the game does" oracle.

## Modes

- Build (both flags off): you set machines, counts, wires; the board reports.
  Solve (`solveMode`): you type product rates; counts are solved. Pool (`solveMode` +
  `poolMode`): no wires; one shared pool per resource.
- Setup rules are gone: `getSetupRules` answers every plan the same
  (`looseCellWires: true`, no free inputs or outputs). Tests needing an open boundary call
  `closeBoundaries`.
- Pool (`pool-mode.ts`, `expandPool`): hidden drawers and wires are added before the
  solve so the ordinary rules apply unchanged. Feeders + takers = a buffer (strict under
  Match, so intermediates balance; overflow under Ignore), feeders only = product drain,
  takers only = import source. Anything that walks the
  graph asks `getPoolProject(project)` first. Cell/fluid pairs bridge through a hidden
  free Tank using Canner-fetched litres (`poolCellRatios`), only from a side something feeds.
- Production groups (Pool only; Build and wired Solve ignore them): `productionGroupId` on
  nodes and storages, the tree in `productionGroups`, rules in `poolResourceRules` (root)
  and each group's `resourceRules`. Ignore is stored as `import` at the root, `share` in a
  group. Children resolve first, and a parent rule cannot undo a child's match.
  - Match (default): in a group, materials made and used there balance locally and
    one-sided ones reach the parent; at the root, anything nobody makes is imported.
    Pool Solve balances intermediates exactly, so a fixed input drives the chain.
  - Ignore: in a group, both sides pass to the parent; at the root, imports and surplus
    are allowed. It is permission to import: machinery is minimized first, so an unpinned
    producer may idle (pin its count).
  - Legacy scoped targets and direct outside-supply rules still load, labelled and editable.
  - Exams: `production-groups.test.ts` (solver and store), `input-driven-chain.test.ts`.

## Drawers and targets

- `model/storage-target.ts` is the one interpretation of `targetPerSecond` / `targetMode`
  (at-least, exact, ignore, at-most), shared by wired Solve and Pool. At most is a
  ceiling, not a demand. Build keeps settings dormant.
- Buffer modes: overflow banks surplus (Build's default); strict clogs (wired Solve's
  default for intermediates, see `effectiveBufferMode`); ratio splits by weights on both
  sides with a Setup output share (`storage-ratios.ts` here and in model/). Pool ignores
  manual ratio splits.
- Drain drawers cycle product / byproduct / trash. Trash is free disposal with its books
  voided (`applyTrashedOutputBalances`). Old trash-can nodes convert on load.
- In Build, targets are display arithmetic; in Solve and Pool they are LP rows.

## Coupling and verdicts

The verdict and ring-diagnosis code lives in `src/components/flow/` (`node-verdict.ts`,
`death-spiral.ts`, `clog-lock.ts`, `bare-slots.ts`).

- Shared machines: `expandSharedMachines` stands each extra section up as a hidden node;
  the ONLY coupling is a time row (`listSharedMachineGroups`): sections' acts sum to at
  most one. A section held by that row reads BUSY (`findBusySharer`).
- Cell <-> fluid wires expand through a hidden free Tank (`expandCrossFormEdges`).
- Ring diagnoses (`death-spiral.ts`, `clog-lock.ts`) stand down for an unfinished setup
  (a member with no power or a bare slot, `bare-slots.ts`). A card whose takers have all
  stopped reads CLOGGED naming them; a stopped taker's ask is never a deficit.
- A jammed second output reads CLOGGED naming the taker, never BOTTLENECK. A feeder of a
  backed-up machine reads on demand; held-taker checks are relative to the asking card, or
  loops go circular. Every diagnosis treats "stopped by its own setup" as the end.

## Debugging the diagnosis engine (equilibrium.ts)

- Split pull across unequal feeders by saturate-and-reoffer, never need / edge count.
- Never feed the settlement back into capability, demand or disposal mid-descent; damping
  breaks boards.
- Dead-loop tells: capability 1 plus a clog cascade = wrongly zeroed; 0 = truly dead.
- A hungry machine idle under a full buffer: dump the stage LP and check residuals first.
- The hidden cross-form Tank is sized at 1000 machines; larger breaks the LP's range.

## Machine math

`overclock.ts` and `hatch-input.ts` live here; the rules are in
`src/lib/machines/CLAUDE.md`. Steam litres: `getNodeSteamReport` in `power-report.ts`.
